                <!--TODO - Need to verify with the ministry what the description of the project should be-->
                <p> 
                    The purpose of the EACL system is to address the specific need of the Audit and Investigation Branchâ€™s Service Verification Group(SVG) 
                    to deter inappropriate billing for fee-for-service claims by practitioners. 
                    Primarily, this is accomplished by confirming via service verification letters to beneficiaries of the Medical Services Plan (MSP), 
                    that the beneficiaries received the services for which their practitioner has billed MSP. 
                    Normally between 50,000 and 75,000 audit confirmation letters are mailed annually.

                    The Service Verification Audit has three types of audits :
                </p>

                    <p>3. Select Service Audit Confirmation With Questions Letter Run</p>
                </ol>
                <br/>
