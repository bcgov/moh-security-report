                    There are three types of letters that the PharmaCare Audit Patient Confirmation Letters Program produces.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <p>1. Random Patient Confirmation Letters;</p>
                    <p>2. Random Prosthetic and Orthotic (P&amp;O) Confirmation Letters; and,</p>
                    <p>3. Random Medication Review Confirmation Letters.</p>
                </ol>
                <br/>
                <p>1.	The Random Patient Confirmation Letters will have letters mailed to patients to verify if patients with drug claims paid for by PharmaCare actually received the drugs paid for.</p>
                <p>2.	The Random P&amp;O Confirmation Letters will have letters mailed to patients to verify information requesting confirmation of designated medical devices and/or services received. The letter is to confirm that the patient received the medical device that was paid in full or in part for by PharmaCare on their behalf.</p>
                <p>3.	The Random Medication Review Confirmation Letters will have letters mailed to patients to verify that they received the medication review service that the pharmacy entered into PharmaNet for them.</p>
