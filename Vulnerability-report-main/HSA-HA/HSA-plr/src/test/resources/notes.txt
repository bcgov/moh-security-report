The example PRS XML files to not validate. It looks like they have banged in some stuff since they made the schema.
    - The RESPONSE_FORMAT_CODE and RESPONSE_CONTENT_CODE elements are not in the schema
    - The schema only allows for a single GRS_MESSAGE (fixed by adding maxOccurs attribute <xsd:element maxOccurs="unbounded" ref="base:GRS_MESSAGE"/>)
    - The elements of the PRS_PROVIDER are all out of order
