The files in this directory are excluded from the build by the "pom.xml".

They are just example configuration files. Before deploying the application,
configuration files like these must be placed on the application server classpath
in a folder such as "C:\glassfish4\glassfish\domains\domain1\lib\classes" (the 
actual path varies by environment).
