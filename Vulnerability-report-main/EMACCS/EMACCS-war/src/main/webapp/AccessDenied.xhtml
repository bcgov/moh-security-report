            <p>You have reached this page because you have already submitted an authorization request, 
                but we have not yet assigned a user role to you (or your assigned role does not have authority to access this page.)
                This process may take up to 30 days to complete.</p>     
            
            <p> You may also have reached this page if you have not restarted your browser since you initially requested access, 
                in which case please clear your browser history/cache or restart your browser. 
                The first screen you should see is the Log-on screen at the Government of British Columbia web site.</p>
